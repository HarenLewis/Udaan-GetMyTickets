## Udaan - GMT (Get My Tickets)
-----

This project was built for the 
[Udaan Developer Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/hiring/udaan-developer-hiring-challenge/ "Challenge Page").

An API driven approach to booking tickets. Built using [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django"),  [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ "Django Rest Framework") and the UI in [React](https://reactjs.org/ "ReactJs") (incomplete)

### Steps to run the project
 

 1. Clone the respository
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/HarenLewis/Udaan-GetMyTickets.git

    and 
    
       `cd udaan_get_my_tickets`

 2. Install requirements and dependencies.
    
       ` pip install -r requirements.txt`  
    
 3. Create a superuser using the following command: 

       `python manage.py createsuperuser`

 4. Run server

       `./runserver`

Since UI for the API endpoints is WIP, the API can be tested using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/ "Postman").

**_(Endpoint details and description will be added soon.)_**
